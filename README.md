This project is a basic microcontroller-based system that implements a PID control loop.
It interfaces with an SCD30 sensor for temperature (you can also use it for CO2) and environmental
data monitoring, and is built on a Nucleo board.


The project was developed at PUT Poznan as part of a laboratory.
